# Tic-Tac-Toe

Classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Implemented using the module pattern with IIFE(Immediately Invoked Function Expression). The game can be played through the UI or directly via the console

To play in the console:

- Use `gameController.playRound(index)` to place a symbol specifying the cell index (0-8).
- Use `gameController.resetGame()` to restart the game.
